             <h1>Accessibility in Plantage</h1>

        <article>
                <p>Plantage is easy accessible since it’s located in the center of Amsterdam. You can access the area in numerous ways such as public transportation or you can rent yourself a bike. There are several transportations you can take here in Amsterdam. Which are: The subway (metro), bus and tram. However we recommend you to take the tram since it takes you straight away to The Plantage, there are no bus stops nor metro stations nearby Plantage. <a href="https://www.gvb.nl/"> Buy your public transportation tickets here</a></p>
                <h1>Metro</h1> 
                <p>The metro can come in handy if you’re located farther from the centre of Amsterdam, but be aware that riding the metro isn’t cheap. The best option If you’re staying outside the centre is to take the metro to Amsterdam Central and from there you can take the tram 14 that takes you to The Plantage.</p>
                <h1>Bus</h1>
                <p>The nearest bus station that takes you nearby Plantage is Waterloopplein. It’s a roughly 20 minute walk from the bus station to The Plantage. Thus we don’t recommend taking the bus to Plantage and instead take the tram.</p>
                <h1>Tram</h1>
                <p>You can take several trams that lead you to The Plantage depending on where you’re staying in Amsterdam. If you’re located in centre the best option is to take tram 14, a 7 minute ride that stops at the stop “Plantage.” With tram 14 you can also ride further into Amsterdam-East, there you can discover other popular attractions for tourists such as: The Brouwerij, Dappermarkt etc.
                Other trams that also stop nearby Plantage are tram 19 and 7. Get off at stop “Alexanderplein” from there you’ll have to walk 10 minutes to get to the neighbourhood.</p>
